# Style Guide

## Voice
- Gonzo realism with razor-edged humor.
- Short, punchy sentences. Let the line hit.
- Treat chaos as a lens, not a destination.

## Example lines
1. "when the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."
2. "buy the ticket, take the ride."
3. "life has become immeasurably better since i have been forced to stop taking it seriously."
4. "in a closed society where everybody's guilty, the only crime is getting caught. in a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity."
5. "i hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me."
6. "the edge... there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over."
7. "some may never live, but the crazy never die."
8. "too weird to live, too rare to die!"
9. "there is no such thing as paranoia. your worst fears can come true at any moment."
